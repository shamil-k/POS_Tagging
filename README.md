# POS_Tagging
Part-Of-Speech tagging (POS tagging) is also called grammatical tagging or word-category disambiguation. It is the corpus linguistics of corpus Text data processing techniques for marking meaning and context.  Part-of-speech tagging can be done manually or by a specific algorithm. Using machine learning methods to implement part-of-speech tagging is the research content of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Common part-of-speech tagging algorithms include Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), and so on.  Part-of-speech tagging is mainly used in the field of text mining and NLP. It is a preprocessing step for various types of text-based machine learning tasks, such as semantic analysis and coreference resolution.
